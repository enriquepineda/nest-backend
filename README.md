```

## Database migrations

Database migrations for this app use [golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) command-line utility. To simply run existing migration you do not need to download the dependancy. We are running the migration commands via a docker container. However if you want to generate the files you can download/install it locally following these instructions: [https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cli](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cli) and running the following command: `migrate -ext sql -dir sql/migrations -seq -digits 4 <name_of_migration>`
